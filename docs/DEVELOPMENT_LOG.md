# Development Process Log

This document captures the iterative development process between the human developer and the AI coding assistant (Gemini Code Assist). Each entry documents a request-response cycle, providing a dataset for future process mining and improvement, in alignment with the project's core philosophy.

## Entry: 2023-10-28 - Establishing Foundational Documentation & Process Logging

### 1. User Request

> "please create a new commit statement and create a new process that allows us to use this communical channel with me, VS Code, My local filesystem, the UI that has Gemini Code Assist, and all requirements come through this layer, and can be documented to file, the interpretations get logged to file, the interpretations, the clarifications, the code changes already have version control for change analysis via GitHub, but I would like the iterative process documented in order to be mined for process improvement insights."

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The request has two main parts:

1.  **Standard Task**: Create a git commit statement for the previous work (creation of `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`, `USER_JOURNEYS.md`, and updates to `README.md`).
2.  **Meta-Task**: Establish a new, documented process to log our collaborative development cycles for future analysis.

**Execution Plan:**

1.  **Create a Commit Statement**: Draft a `docs` commit summarizing the creation of the foundational project documentation.
2.  **Propose a New Process**:
    - Create a new living document: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
    - Define a structure for entries within this log (Request, Interpretation, Outcome).
    - Bootstrap the log with the current request as the first entry.
3.  **Integrate the Process**: Update the main `README.md` to include a section on this new development process, making it an official part of the project's methodology.

### 3. Outcome

- The commit statement was generated.
- This file, `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, was created.
- The `README.md` was updated to reflect this new process.
- The changes are included in the commit with the message: `docs(process): Establish foundational documentation and development log`.

## Entry: 2023-10-29 - Establishing Collaboration Framework & Context Automation

### 1. User Request

> "can you create a RASCI matrix that represents the responsibilities of myself, and you. And suggest any enablement tools that can allow you as Gemini cod assist to take on the documentation responsibilities and define edge cases where my input is optional and where it is mandatory."
>
> "have you internalized your responsibilities in this process. When I close vscode and reopen it, will you retain your responsibilities for this project?"
>
> "how can I ensure that VSCode takes on the responsibility of providing you with this context each time it loads."

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The user wants to formalize our collaboration and automate the process of providing project context to me.

1.  **Create RASCI Matrix**: Draft a `docs/RASCI_MATRIX.md` file defining our roles (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) for various project tasks.
2.  **Define Enablement Strategy**: Propose a workflow where I take responsibility for documentation updates, and define the edge cases where human input is mandatory.
3.  **Explain AI State**: Clarify that I am stateless between sessions and that the project documentation serves as my "memory".
4.  **Implement Context Automation**: Create a VS Code Task (`.vscode/tasks.json`) and a Node.js script (`scripts/gather-context.js`) to automate the collection of all project documentation into a single block for easy copy-pasting into the chat.

### 3. Outcome

- `docs/RASCI_MATRIX.md` was created to formalize our roles.
- `scripts/gather-context.js` and `.vscode/tasks.json` were created to automate context loading.
- The stateless nature of the AI and the role of documentation as a persistent memory were clarified.
