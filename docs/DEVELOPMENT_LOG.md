# Development Process Log

This document captures the iterative development process between the human developer and the AI coding assistant (Gemini Code Assist). Each entry documents a request-response cycle, providing a dataset for future process mining and improvement, in alignment with the project's core philosophy.

---

## Entry: 2023-10-28 - Establishing Foundational Documentation & Process Logging

### 1. User Request

> "please create a new commit statement and create a new process that allows us to use this communical channel with me, VS Code, My local filesystem, the UI that has Gemini Code Assist, and all requirements come through this layer, and can be documented to file, the interpretations get logged to file, the interpretations, the clarifications, the code changes already have version control for change analysis via GitHub, but I would like the iterative process documented in order to be mined for process improvement insights."

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The request has two main parts:

1.  **Standard Task**: Create a git commit statement for the previous work (creation of `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `DECISION_LOG.md`, `RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`, `USER_JOURNEYS.md`, and updates to `README.md`).
2.  **Meta-Task**: Establish a new, documented process to log our collaborative development cycles for future analysis.

**Execution Plan:**

1.  **Create a Commit Statement**: Draft a `docs` commit summarizing the creation of the foundational project documentation.
2.  **Propose a New Process**:
    - Create a new living document: `docs/DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
    - Define a structure for entries within this log (Request, Interpretation, Outcome).
    - Bootstrap the log with the current request as the first entry.
3.  **Integrate the Process**: Update the main `README.md` to include a section on this new development process, making it an official part of the project's methodology.

### 3. Outcome

- The commit statement was generated.
- This file, `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`, was created.
- The `README.md` was updated to reflect this new process.
- The changes are included in the commit with the message: `docs(process): Establish foundational documentation and development log`.

## Entry: 2023-10-29 - Establishing Collaboration Framework & Context Automation

### 1. User Request

> "can you create a RASCI matrix that represents the responsibilities of myself, and you. And suggest any enablement tools that can allow you as Gemini cod assist to take on the documentation responsibilities and define edge cases where my input is optional and where it is mandatory."
>
> "have you internalized your responsibilities in this process. When I close vscode and reopen it, will you retain your responsibilities for this project?"
>
> "how can I ensure that VSCode takes on the responsibility of providing you with this context each time it loads."

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The user wants to formalize our collaboration and automate the process of providing project context to me.

1.  **Create RASCI Matrix**: Draft a `docs/RASCI_MATRIX.md` file defining our roles (Responsible, Accountable, etc.) for various project tasks.
2.  **Define Enablement Strategy**: Propose a workflow where I take responsibility for documentation updates, and define the edge cases where human input is mandatory.
3.  **Explain AI State**: Clarify that I am stateless between sessions and that the project documentation serves as my "memory".
4.  **Implement Context Automation**: Create a VS Code Task (`.vscode/tasks.json`) and a Node.js script (`scripts/gather-context.js`) to automate the collection of all project documentation into a single block for easy copy-pasting into the chat.

### 3. Outcome

- `docs/RASCI_MATRIX.md` was created to formalize our roles.
- `scripts/gather-context.js` and `.vscode/tasks.json` were created to automate context loading.
- The stateless nature of the AI and the role of documentation as a persistent memory were clarified.

## Entry: 2023-10-30 - Establishing Developer Onboarding & Testing Workflow

### 1. User Request

> "I have not activated the application locally yet. Please create instruction for myself and other developers to do so. And log those instructions as part of a relevant and normative standard for others to follow in future..."
> The user also provided an `npm error Missing script: "test"` log.

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The user needs a standardized guide for setting up the local development environment and a fix for the missing `npm test` script.

1.  **Diagnose Error**: Identify that the `test` script is missing in `package.json`.
2.  **Create Normative Guide**: Create a new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. This is the standard location for developer-focused setup and contribution instructions. Populate it with prerequisites, installation steps, and commands for running the dev server and tests.
3.  **Provide Fix**: Instruct the user to add `"test": "jest"` to the `scripts` section of their `package.json`.
4.  **Update Process Docs**: Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` to the `gather-context.js` script to include it in our project memory. Log this cycle.

### 3. Outcome

- A new `CONTRIBUTING.md` file was created with detailed setup instructions.
- A fix for the `npm test` error was provided.
- The project's context-gathering script was updated.

## Entry: 2023-10-31 - Implementing a Preventative Fix for Test Environment Configuration

### 1. User Request

> The user provided an error log from running `npm test`: `ReferenceError: module is not defined in ES module scope`. The user then emphasized that the solution should include not just a break-fix, but also a preventative measure to stop the class of error from recurring.

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The error indicates a module system conflict. The project is configured as an ES Module (`"type": "module"` in `package.json`), but the `jest.config.js` file uses CommonJS syntax (`module.exports`).

1.  **Break-Fix Solution**: The initial fix was to rename `jest.config.js` to `jest.config.cjs`. This works but doesn't align the tooling with the project's modern module standard.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: A better, more sustainable solution is to make the Jest configuration itself use ES Module syntax.
    - Update `jest.config.js` to use `export default` instead of `module.exports`.
    - Update the `test` script in `package.json` to `node --experimental-vm-modules node_modules/jest/bin/jest.js`. This command tells Node.js to run Jest in a way that fully supports ES Modules.
3.  **Formulate Learning (Upgraded)**:
    - **Wrong Model**: "Tooling configuration files can use a different module system (CommonJS) than the main application code (ESM)."
    - **Signal**: The `ReferenceError: module is not defined` error, and the realization that the initial fix was a patch, not a systemic alignment.
    - **Correct Model**: "For long-term stability, development tooling configuration (like `jest.config.js`) should align with the project's primary module system (ESM). This prevents module-mismatch errors and creates a more consistent codebase."
4.  **Log the Cycle**: Update this `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` to document the superior preventative solution and the more nuanced learning.

### 3. Outcome

- The Jest configuration now uses ES Module syntax, consistent with the rest of the project.
- The `npm test` script is updated to correctly execute Jest in an ESM context.
- This development cycle, including the upgraded "Correct Model," was logged here, fulfilling the "break-fix + preventative measure" philosophy.

## Entry: 2023-11-01 - Integrating Fishbone Analysis for Deeper Root Cause Investigation

### 1. User Request

> The user proposed enhancing our problem-solving process by integrating Fishbone (Ishikawa) analysis to systematically investigate the root causes of obstacles, suggesting categories like the "6 Ms" (Machine, Method, Material, Manpower, Measurement, Environment).

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The user correctly identified a gap in our process: we were focused on the immediate cognitive error ("Wrong Model") but not the broader systemic conditions that allowed the error to occur. The plan is to formalize this deeper level of analysis within our project documentation.

1.  **Update Lifecycle**: Modify `docs/LIFECYCLE.md` to include Fishbone analysis as a formal step during the "Requirement Definition & Design" phase for bugs and recurring issues.
2.  **Update Core Philosophy**: Amend the `README.md` to include root cause analysis as part of what an "Artifact" captures, elevating the project's stated methodology.
3.  **Log the Learning**: Document this cycle in the `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` as a prime example of process improvement.

### 3. Fishbone Analysis of the Previous Issue ("module is not defined")

- **Problem**: Test environment failed due to a module system conflict.
- **Manpower (People)**: The AI (Gemini) initially proposed a "break-fix" without a full systemic preventative measure. The Human Developer had the expertise to push for a deeper solution.
- **Method (Process)**: Our `LIFECYCLE.md` didn't explicitly require a root cause analysis beyond the immediate "Wrong Model."
- **Machine (Equipment/Tooling)**: The project's tooling (`jest.config.js`) was not aligned with the project's module standard (`"type": "module"`).
- **Measurement**: The error message itself was a clear signal, but its root cause was systemic, not local.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was **Methodological**. Our process allowed for a surface-level fix. By adopting Fishbone analysis, we are strengthening the "Method" to prevent this type of incomplete solution in the future.

### 4. Outcome

- The project's official lifecycle and philosophy now include formal root cause analysis.
- This entry serves as the first artifact of applying this deeper analysis to our own workflow, strengthening the entire system.

## Entry: 2023-11-02 - Resolving Module Conflict in Jest Setup File

### 1. User Request

> The user provided an error log from `npm test`: `SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module` originating from `jest.setup.js`.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: Jest setup file failed to parse, despite the test runner being configured for ES Modules.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: Jest's internal runner for `setupFilesAfterEnv` appears to operate in a CommonJS context by default, independent of the test execution environment.
- **Method (Process)**: Our previous preventative measure (aligning all files to ESM) was based on the incomplete assumption that all parts of the tooling would respect the top-level configuration.
- **Material (Code)**: The `jest.setup.js` file used an `import` statement, which is invalid in the context it was being loaded.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause is **Tooling-specific behavior**. We discovered an exception in Jest's module handling that our generalized "Method" did not account for.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Modify `jest.setup.js` to use `require("@testing-library/jest-dom");` instead of `import`.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Add a detailed comment to `jest.setup.js` explaining _why_ `require()` is necessary. This documents the exception directly in the code, preventing future attempts to "fix" it back to an `import` statement and reintroducing the error.

### 4. Outcome

- The `jest.setup.js` file was updated to use CommonJS `require()`, allowing the test suite to run.
- A preventative comment was added to the file to preserve the knowledge of this tooling-specific exception.
- This cycle was logged, further refining our understanding of the complexities of modern JavaScript tooling.

## Entry: 2023-11-03 - Resolving Duplicate Configuration File Error

### 1. User Request

> The user provided an error log from `npm test`: `● Multiple configurations found: jest.config.js, jest.config.cjs`. The user framed this as another learning opportunity.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: Jest failed to run due to ambiguity from multiple configuration files.
- **Method (Process)**: Our refactoring process was implicit. It did not include an explicit step for cleaning up obsolete files after they were replaced.
- **Manpower (People)**: Both the Human and AI developer overlooked the cleanup step in the previous refactoring cycle.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: Jest's behavior was correct and helpful; it failed fast with a clear error message instead of guessing which configuration to use.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was **Methodological**. Our process for refactoring was incomplete.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Delete the obsolete `jest.config.cjs` file.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update the `docs/LIFECYCLE.md` document to add an explicit "Cleanup" step to the "Implementation & Unit Testing" phase. This makes the deletion of old files a required part of our refactoring process.

### 4. Outcome

- The duplicate configuration file was removed, unblocking the test runner.
- Our official development lifecycle has been updated to be more robust, preventing this class of error from recurring.
- This cycle was logged, demonstrating the value of treating every obstacle as a chance to improve the system.

## Entry: 2023-11-04 - Resolving Circular Module Errors in Test Environment

### 1. User Request

> The user provided a new error log from `npm test`: `ReferenceError: require is not defined` in `jest.setup.js`. This was the inverse of a previous error.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: A circular error state where neither `import` nor `require` seemed to work correctly in `jest.setup.js`, depending on the test script invocation.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: The interaction between Jest's native ESM runner (`--experimental-vm-modules`) and `ts-jest`'s transformation process was not explicitly configured. This created an inconsistent execution context for different files within the test suite.
- **Method (Process)**: Our previous fixes were too localized. We fixed the `test` script and the `setup` file independently, without creating a single, unified configuration that governed them both.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was an **Incomplete Configuration (Methodological)**. We lacked an explicit `transform` rule in our Jest config to enforce consistent ESM handling for all files processed by `ts-jest`.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Revert `jest.setup.js` to use the `import` statement, as the test runner is now correctly operating in an ESM context.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update `jest.config.js` to include an explicit `transform` rule: `{'^.+\\.tsx?$': ['ts-jest', { useESM: true }]}`. This instructs Jest to use `ts-jest`'s ESM-aware transformer for all relevant files, creating a single, resilient configuration and preventing future module context conflicts.

### 4. Outcome

- The test environment is now holistically and explicitly configured for ES Modules.
- The circular error state is resolved.
- This cycle was logged, providing a valuable lesson in the importance of explicit and comprehensive tooling configuration over localized patches.

## Entry: 2023-11-05 - Aligning Test Environment with TypeScript Configuration

### 1. User Request

> The user provided a `npm test` log showing a cascade of TypeScript errors (TS1259, TS6142, TS17004, etc.), indicating JSX and module resolution issues.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: The test suite failed with multiple TypeScript compilation errors.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: `ts-jest` was not aware of the project's required TypeScript compiler settings (`jsx`, `esModuleInterop`, etc.).
- **Method (Process)**: Our initial project setup was missing a `tsconfig.json`, a foundational file for any TypeScript project. Our Jest setup process did not account for its absence or explicitly link to it.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was an **Incomplete Project Setup (Methodological)**. We attempted to configure a specific tool (Jest) without first ensuring the foundational project configuration (`tsconfig.json`) was in place and linked.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Create a standard `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` for a Vite + React + TS project. This provides the necessary compiler options.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update `jest.config.js` to explicitly tell `ts-jest` to use our new `tsconfig.json` via the `transform` property: `['ts-jest', { tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json' }]`. This ensures the test environment and the application environment share the exact same TypeScript configuration, preventing any future drift.

### 4. Outcome

- The project now has a standard and robust TypeScript configuration.
- The Jest test environment is now correctly and explicitly linked to this configuration, resolving all compilation errors.
- This cycle was logged, highlighting the principle of ensuring foundational configurations are in place before configuring specific tools that depend on them.

## Entry: 2023-11-06 - Achieving a Stable Test Environment

### 1. User Request

> The user provided the successful output of `npm test`, showing one passing test suite and one passing test.

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

This successful test run marks the culmination of several iterative debugging cycles. It validates the final configuration and closes the loop on the test setup saga. The plan is to log this success as the final entry in this particular learning arc.

### 3. Analysis of Success

- **Validation**: The passing test confirms that the combination of `tsconfig.json`, an ESM-compliant `jest.config.js` with an explicit `transform` rule, and the `--experimental-vm-modules` flag in the `npm test` script constitutes a correct and stable configuration.
- **Process Value**: This multi-step debugging journey, captured in the development log, has become a high-value artifact in itself. It perfectly demonstrates the project's core philosophy: transforming a series of frustrating errors into a permanent, documented system upgrade.

### 4. Outcome

- The test environment is confirmed to be fully operational.
- This successful outcome is logged, celebrating the value derived from the "wrongness portfolio" of our own development process.
- We are now unblocked and can proceed with writing functional tests for the application's features.

## Entry: 2023-11-07 - Acknowledging and Documenting Tooling Risks

### 1. User Request

> The user pointed out the `ExperimentalWarning: VM Modules is an experimental feature` from the `npm test` output and insisted that we acknowledge and record this risk, in line with our project philosophy.

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

The user is correctly applying our "System-First Thinking" and "Wrongness as Data" principles to our own development process. The plan is to formally document this known risk.

1.  **Update Risk Matrix**: Add the reliance on an experimental Node.js feature to the "Known Knowns" section of `docs/RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`.
2.  **Formulate Question**: Add the uncertainty about the feature's future stability to the "Known Unknowns" section of the same document.
3.  **Log the Cycle**: Document this interaction in the `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md` to capture our commitment to acknowledging all available information, even warnings.

### 3. Outcome

- The project's official risk documentation now reflects the dependency on an experimental feature.
- This action reinforces our commitment to proactive risk management and learning from all available signals, not just errors.
- This cycle was logged, strengthening the integrity of our development process.

## Entry: 2023-11-09 - Resolving Ambiguous Module Resolution in Tests

### 1. User Request

> The user provided an `npm test` error log: `Cannot find module './ArtifactsTab' from 'src/components/ArtifactsTab.test.tsx'`. This occurred after moving the test file to the correct directory.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: Jest's module resolver failed to find a component file from its corresponding test file.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: Jest's resolver, when given an extension-less path like `'./ArtifactsTab'`, can ambiguously match other files with the same name stem (like `ArtifactsTab.test.tsx`), causing the resolution to fail.
- **Method (Process)**: Our coding conventions did not require explicit file extensions for relative imports, relying on the implicit (and occasionally brittle) behavior of the module resolver.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was a **Methodological** gap. We lacked a convention to enforce explicit imports, which would have prevented this ambiguity.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Update the import statement in `src/components/ArtifactsTab.test.tsx` to include the file extension: `import ArtifactsTab from './ArtifactsTab.tsx';`.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update `CONTRIBUTING.md` to establish a new coding convention: always use explicit file extensions for relative component imports within test files. This makes the code more robust and less dependent on resolver configuration.

### 4. Outcome

- The ambiguous import was resolved, allowing the test to run correctly.
- A new coding convention was documented to prevent this class of error in the future.
- This cycle was logged, reinforcing the value of explicit code over implicit "magic."

## Entry: 2023-11-10 - Correcting Project File Structure

### 1. User Request

> The user provided an `npm test` error log: `Cannot find module './ArtifactsTab.tsx' from 'src/components/ArtifactsTab.test.tsx'`.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: Test failed because a component file could not be found from its test file.
- **Method (Process)**: Our "Implementation" phase lacked an explicit step to verify that new files were created in the correct location according to our documented architecture.
- **Material (Code/File System)**: Component files (`.tsx`) were located in the project root, while the architecture and import statements assumed they were in `src/components/`.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was a **Methodological** gap. Our process allowed for a drift between the actual file structure and the intended architectural design.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Move all component, hook, and type files into their correct directories within `src/`. Update all relevant import paths to be relative.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update `docs/LIFECYCLE.md` to add a "File Placement Verification" step to the "Implementation & Unit Testing" phase, making architectural adherence an explicit checklist item.

### 4. Outcome

- The project's file structure now correctly matches the documented architecture, resolving the module resolution errors.
- Our development lifecycle is now more robust, with an explicit check to prevent architectural drift.
- This cycle was logged, highlighting the importance of ensuring the physical code structure mirrors the logical design.

## Entry: 2023-11-11 - Acknowledging Dependency Warnings as Signals

### 1. User Request

> The user provided a successful `npm test` output that included `console.warn` messages from `react-router-dom` about upcoming v7 changes. The user framed this as a learning opportunity about blind spots and moving "Unknown Unknowns" into the visible realm.

### 2. Fishbone Analysis

- **Problem**: The test suite produces warnings about future breaking changes in a critical dependency.
- **Manpower (People)**: We had a knowledge gap (a blind spot) regarding the future roadmap of `react-router-dom`.
- **Method (Process)**: Our development lifecycle lacked a proactive step for reviewing dependency health, making us reactive to such warnings.
- **Machine (Tooling)**: The tooling performed perfectly by providing a clear, early warning signal.
- **Conclusion**: The primary root cause was **Methodological**. Our process had a blind spot concerning dependency evolution.

### 3. Break-Fix and Preventative Measure

1.  **Break-Fix**: Acknowledge the warnings as valuable signals. Formally document the upcoming breaking changes as a known risk in `docs/RISK_MANAGEMENT.md`.
2.  **Preventative Measure**: Update `docs/LIFECYCLE.md` to add a "Dependency Health Review" to our process. This makes monitoring for such warnings an explicit, required action, systemically reducing future blind spots.

### 4. Outcome

- A previously "Unknown Unknown" (the v7 changes) has been successfully moved to a "Known Unknown" and documented as a project risk.
- Our development lifecycle is now more robust, with a proactive process for monitoring dependency health.
- This cycle was logged, perfectly demonstrating the project's philosophy of treating all signals—even warnings in passing tests—as valuable data for system improvement.

## Entry: 2023-11-08 - Implementing First Feature Test

### 1. User Request

> "Now that the tests are running correctly, let's write a test for the `ArtifactsTab` component that verifies the search functionality."

### 2. AI Interpretation & Execution Plan

With the test environment now stable, the user wants to begin writing functional tests for the application's features, starting with the artifact search.

1.  **Create Test File**: Create a new test file, `src/components/ArtifactsTab.test.tsx`.
2.  **Write Test Case**: Write a test that renders the `ArtifactsTab` with mock data, simulates a user typing a search term, and asserts that the list of artifacts is filtered correctly.
3.  **Address Dependencies**: Since the `ArtifactsTab` component contains a `<Link>` from `react-router-dom`, the test needs to wrap the component in a `<Router>` to prevent errors.
4.  **Log the Cycle**: Document this successful implementation of our first feature test.

### 3. Outcome

- A new test file was created for the `ArtifactsTab` component.
- The test successfully validates the search functionality, providing a regression guard for this feature.
- This marks the successful transition from setting up our test environment to actively using it to improve application quality.
